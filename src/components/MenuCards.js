                Be the first to come forward and tell your parents that their happiness and approval are important to you, but so is your self-directed path and personal growth. Make them feel your sincerity about both sides of the issue.

Ask them for a solution rather than insisting on your own. I doubt that your parents are totally fixed and intractable. See if you can partially share a vision of the future in which you and they are both happy. But don’t take everything on your shoulders. Perhaps money, security, and work are part of the whole situation, so be open about this. For some in your parents’ generation, spirituality feels like ‘hippies’ with no sense of responsibility. Whatever their attitude might be, it is not up to you to change it. Your responsibility is only to negotiate so that two different viewpoints can find common ground. I hope this helps.


Being is universal reality. Can educating people on Being bring about holistic health — physical, mental, emotional and ecological health? Shashidhara G


Dear Shashidhara,
Being is not a subject like biology and physics that can be disseminated in school. In fact, it isn’t a topic at all, which is a problem for anyone attempting to teach anything about consciousness. For most people, Being and consciousness are taken for granted. We exist and we think. This is about as far as it goes for the majority of people. What changes this passive attitude is the spark of awakening, because as the scriptures say, it takes only a spark to burn down the forest. Every life has room for a spark to occur, which means a moment of clear self-awareness. If such moments catch a person’s attention, awakening can begin. If a person’s attention is fixed on external values, no amount of well-intended advice or instruction will make a difference.


Your letter speaks in universal terms, but I am sure you take these issues personally; therefore, direct your attention to people in your life who show interest in awakening. You might be surprised at who in your close circle has thought about such matters. Have a conversation in which you are not just the teacher but a sympathetic equal. Find out where the other person is, how they feel about their life, and what direction they are heading in. Having made a personal connection, you can begin to talk about your spiritual convictions. Just be aware that if you behave like a teacher, an authority, or an evangelist, you are likely to get nowhere.


In today’s extremely competitive world, does spirituality really give you an edge over someone who has limited or no inclination towards spirituality? SP Sharma, 16


Dear SP,
If you are asking because you want to gain an edge, your need to compete and succeed won’t be boosted by spirituality. This isn’t due to a failure of spirit. In consciousness there are infinite possibilities, and once you begin to investigate the world ‘in here,’ very valuable and important things begin to unfold. But this is an inner journey, not a business-school programme. There are countless successful people who have no interest in their inner world, and countless people who do. It is critical to realise that the Indian tradition doesn’t judge against success. Dharma, artha, kama, and moksha should not be divided. They are all achievable in consciousness, and the more awake you are, the easier they are to achieve.
The goal isn’t first success, then spirituality. To be spiritual adds meaning and purpose to success, which is neutral on its own and sometimes empty. By all means, let your awareness expand wherever it wants to go. But in this narrow issue of how to get an edge in life, the first priority is a good education, especially at your age.■
